## UTILS
In the `./utils` directory, there is a script `generate_abi.js` that processes the contract name (without the `.sol` extension) to generate the ABI from Foundry's output directory. Ensure you build the foundry project beforehand. Then, move this generated json to `front/src/abi` directory.

To execute the `.js` scripts enter to that directory:
```bash
cd utils
```

execute the script
```bash
node generate_abi.js <contract_name_without_sol_extension>
```
